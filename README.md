# ZS-GNT  
**Graph Network-Based Analysis of Disease-Gene-Drug Associations: Zero-Shot Disease-Drug Prediction and Analysis Strategies**  

## Overview  
This repository provides the implementation of the ZS-GNT model, a graph network-based approach for analyzing disease-gene-drug associations. The model enables zero-shot disease-drug prediction and provides strategies for efficient analysis.
